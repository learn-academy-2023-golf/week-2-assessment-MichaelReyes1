# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: 
parameter = (name)

const greeting = (name) => {
    return 
}
argument = "mike"
console.log(greeting("mike"))

Researched answer: the difference is that the parameter is a placeholder () and a argument is the actual content being passed once being invoked.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: classes are the blueprint for a object

Researched answer: also remember it by objects being the intersecton of data and behavior and classes are like a function that contain that data and behavior. 

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: i = perform a action until a condition is met

Researched answer: so its really performing a action a certain number of times or until a condition is met and a common one we use is a for loop.

Researched answer: is a behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution.
